This folder contains the following 6 files:

1. BloomFilter.java 
2. BloomFilter_output.txt
3. CountingBloomFilter.java
4. CountingBloomFilter_output.txt
5. CodedBloomFilter.java
6. CodedBloomFilter_output.txt

No extra dependencies are required to run the files. Just running them normally would work. 
Every time you run the file though, a different answer is possible because it uses a random value for elements and to use when calculating hash values.
