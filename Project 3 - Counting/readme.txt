This folder includes a total of 6 files, as listed below: 

1. CountingMin.java
2. CountingMin_output.txt
3. CounterSketch.java
4. CounterSketch_output.txt
5. ActiveCounter.java
6. ActiveCounter_output.txt


Each of them are either the source code of the specified algorithm or its output file. 
Because the algorithms relies quite a bit on random numbers generated for calculating the hash values, it is possible that the output of each file can vary every time. However, it stays under a certain range. For counting min, it usually ranges form 120 - 126, for counter sketch, it is about 250 - 300 and for active counter it is approximately a million.
